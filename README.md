Employee Data Management System

This project is a simple Java program that stores employee data (name, last name, salary, and position) in an ArrayList and sorts it based on last name,
first name, and salary.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
Any Java IDE (such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans) to open and run the project.

When you run the file, the original data will be displayed and the sorted data will be displayed below it.
This project can be further developed to be more interactive with the user and include additional functionality such as updating or deleting employee data.
